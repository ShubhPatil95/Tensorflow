TensorFlow is an open source library developed by the Google Brain Team.Itâ€™s an extremely versatile library,
originally created for tasks that require heavy numerical computations. For this reason, TensorFlow was geared
towards the problem of machine learning, and deep neural networks.
<strong> Due to a C/C++ backend, TensorFlow is able to run faster than pure Python code.</strong>
